# CollabSpace

CollabSpace is a project-driven collaborative workspace platform built to understand how real-world full-stack systems are designed, developed, and scaled.

The goal of this project is not just feature development, but learning *why* certain architectural, performance, and scalability decisions are made while building production-like systems.

The project evolves version by version, gradually introducing complexity as the system grows.
